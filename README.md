## 16S and metagenomic analyses for a laboratory incubation experiment with sediments from the Timberlake
### Collaborating with Emily Bernhardt and Marcelo Ard贸n
### Building upon their previous publications Ard贸n et al. 2013, Ard贸n et al. 2016, Ard贸n et al. 2018
### Samples are field samples and laboratory incubations with DI water (Control), +SO4, +ASW, +ASW-SO4
### Examine how microbial communities and genes were affected by the manipulations and how this relates to the observed increase in methane flux
