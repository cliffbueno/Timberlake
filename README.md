## 16S and metagenomic analyses for a laboratory incubation experiment with sediments from the Timberlake Observatory for Wetland Restoration, North Carolina
### Collaborating with Emily Bernhardt and Marcelo Ard贸n
### Building upon their previous publications:
Ard贸n et al. 2013, Global Change Biology https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.12287 \
Ard贸n et al. 2016, Biogeochemistry https://doi.org/10.1007/s10533-016-0189-5 \
Ard贸n et al. 2018, Biogeochemistry https://doi.org/10.1007/s10533-018-0486-2
### Samples are field samples and laboratory incubations with DI water (Control), +SO4, +ASW, +ASW-SO4
### Examine how microbial communities and genes were affected by the manipulations and how this relates to the observed increase in methane flux
